# Introduction 
The python script is for the team building challenge and creates teams of 5 or 6 from a list of users. 

# Getting Started
1. (Optional) Install xlrd module if using .xls (Open python and enter 'pip install xlrd').
2. Place the list of names in the same directory as this script. If multiple files are found, this script will grab the first file based on the order in the 'Supported list formats' below.
3. (Optional) Define the list file as an argument.
4. An HTML report will be generated and automatically opened with the option to copy the teams to the clipboard.
5. (Optional) Easter egg: Define no file argument AND make sure no supported files are in the same directory.

Supported list formats: csv, xls, txt (newline separated)
